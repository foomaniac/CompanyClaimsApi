# CompanyClaimsApi


## Introduction

This API exposes endpoints that provide informstion on a company and it's attributes, as well as claims links to that company.

For reference the API follows a vertical slice approach to it's solution structure, the reason for this being it has minimal responsibilities so I felt it suited this structure for this first interation. Would expect to have a discussion about this prior to any new api build.
